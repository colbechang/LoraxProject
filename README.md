# Lorax Project

We have created an application to explore and contribute to climate change data for governing bodies, researchers, activists, or anyone who would like to educate themselves and the world. Our UI allows access to a database of climate change emissions (radiative forcing) and effects trends by industry and by specific location. It also has an extensive catalog of each cityâ€™s individual citizen carbon footprint, adaptation techniques, mitigation techniques, and energy generation methods.

In our src folder, we have:
- governments
- activists
- researchers
- dictatorship
